The first 6 week after transplanting is the critical time of weed competition two or three timely weeding will provide adequate weed control
Use rotary weeder or cono weeder thrice at 7-10 days interval from 10-15 days after planting on either direction of the rows and column.
Flood the field for 2-3 day after transplanting and a 5 cm water depth should be maintained throughout the growing season if weeds are problem in that area.
Manual weeding is also essential to remove the weeds closer to rice root zone.

 Flooding the field followed by dragging a rope across the field and draining out the water from the field.
Swarming caterpillar: Spodoptera mauritia
 Kerosenate the water while irrigation - suffocation
 Allow ducks into the field
 Drain the water
 ...

... 
 
## Disease management

### Blast: Pyricularia oryzae
Plant a resistant variety
Removes weed hosts from bunds
Burning of straw and stubbles after harvest

Dry seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens talc formulation @10g/kg of seed
Spray Pseudomonas fluorescens talc formulation @ 0.5% at 45, 55 and 65 DAT
...
### Brown Spot: Bipolaris oryzae
Plant varieties that are resistant to brown spot
Use clean, fungicide-treated seed
...
### Sheath Blight: Rhizoctonia solani

...
## Harvesting: 
Harvest the rice when the grains are fully matured and filled so as to get maximum quality and quantity.
Harvesting can be done when the crop looks dried appearance due to drying of all most all the leaves.
