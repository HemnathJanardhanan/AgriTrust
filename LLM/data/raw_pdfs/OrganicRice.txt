What is organic rice?
Organic rice is cultivated by using natural and not chemical fertilizers, which are harmful to health and environment as well.

Challenges for Organic Rice Cultivation
Rice is the major crop that receives maximum quantity of fertilizers (40%) and pesticides          (17-18%) and 
These practices pose major challenges in organic rice farming for nutrient and pest management.
Yield reduces in the conversion (initial) period.


Step for organic rice production
Nursery Management
i) Nutrient Management
During seed bed preparation, organic manures such as FYM, Compost, vermin - compost can be used @ 5t/ha of nursery area.
Gana jeeva amuruth :200kg/acre
ii) Seed treatment
 Plant protection 
Beejamrut: 3 liter/ac of Seeds
Prevents seed borne disease

Bio fertilizer
Azospirillum and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria 10 gram each/kg of Seeds.
 
Uses:  Fix atmospheric nitrogen 30-35 kg N/ha/season, solubilizes phosphorus and silicon and induce drought tolerant.

Special nursery management  Practices 
i) Dhrava jeeva amrut (7 DAS)
	1 ac : 200 litres
ii) Sour butter milk (9 DAS)
	1 ac 100 liter water + 3 liter sourbutter milk
Benefit: 
	Strengthen the seed and 
Increase the milking stage and reduces the pest incidence  (Main filed)

Organic manure application
During land preparation 10 t of FYM/ha + 5 tons paddy straw and 10 tones of in-situ grown dhaincha/sunhemp green manure/ha needs to be incorporated. 

In the last puddle, vermi-compost @ 2 t/ha may be applied (optional). 

Through these organics, approximately 150 kg N, 40 -50 kg P2O5, 100 - 120 kg K2O and micronutrients can be supplied.

SPECIAL TECHNIQUES FOLLOWED IN MAINFIELD:
Apply Gana jeevamruth: 200 kg / ac
Dry rice straw:10 kg
N: growing legumes plants as cover crop
P: Fish  bone meal
K: rice straw and manures
Apply Navadhanayaa mixed powder  at first showering time: indirect source for N, P, K and about 16 essential nutrients.

Bio - fertilizers
Bio-fertilizers such as Azospirillum or PSB/PSM @    2 - 3 kg /ha mixed with 25 kg FYM or VC and applied to the soil just before planting. 

Blue green algae @ 10 kg/ha, 10 days after planting.
 
Apply azolla @ 1 t/ha, 7-10 days after transplanting and incorporated after 3 weeks. 

Special Care after Transplanting
After transplanting once per 15 days spray with 
Fish meal amino acid (Fish meal is a good source phosphorus 12%) and 
Dharava jeeva amrut - 200 liter/ac Spray 4 times in crop period.
Panchakavya: apply 10th, 15th, 30th  & 50th day 
Spray 6 lit of sourbutter milk/ac in 200 liter of water: At milking stage: 

Weed suppression
Weed control and soil fertility are the principal challenges associated with organic rice production. 
Primary weed - control practices include crop rotations,  land leveling, seedbed preparation.
Water management.
Rotary hoeing. 

Pest and disease management

Agniyasthiram - removes 75% of insect and pest.
20 liters of cow urine and tobacco leaves And 3 kg of Neem leaves and 0.5kg of garlic and 3 Kg of Custard Apple Leaves and 0.5 kg of green chilli
Agni yasthiram - 200ml /10 l of water in addition to this neemayasthiram is used
Fall armyworm and chinch bug - flush of water.
Stinkbugs and water weevils - Timely planting, variety selection and cultural practices.
